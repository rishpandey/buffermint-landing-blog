When we wrote this guide in 2021, a non-technical founder had two routes to a first product: hire freelancers or hire an agency. In 2026 there is a third, and it's the one most founders try first: describe the app to an AI builder such as Lovable, Bolt or Replit and let it write the code. This rewrite compares the three routes on cost and risk, gives the security checks that every route needs, and keeps the part of the old guide that aged best: how to be a client that developers do good work for.

It also replaces three of our older posts, on launching a startup from idea to reality, on things to know before a first tech startup, and on being an excellent client. The useful parts of each are below.

## The three routes, side by side

| | AI app builder | Freelancer | Partner or agency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Typical cost to a first version | $25–100 a month in plans and credits | Thousands of dollars (see below) | More than a freelancer, usually as a fixed price |
| Time to something clickable | Days | Weeks | Weeks |
| Who checks security | You | The freelancer, if you ask | The partner, if it's in the contract |
| Who you call when it breaks | Nobody; the AI and you | The freelancer, if they're available | The partner, under a support agreement |
| Best for | Testing an idea with real users | A defined MVP with clear scope | Regulated data, payments, deadlines |

The prices are as of October 2026. Lovable's Pro plan is $25 a month for 100 credits, and its Business plan $50 ([Lovable docs](https://docs.lovable.dev/introduction/subscription-plans)). Bolt's Pro plan is $25 a month for 10 million tokens ([Bolt](https://bolt.new/pricing)). Replit's Core plan is $20 a month and Pro $100, each including that amount in usage credits ([Replit](https://replit.com/pricing)). We compare the builders in detail, with what a typical build burns, in [building an app without coding in 2026](/articles/how-to-leverage-ai-and-build-an-app-without-coding).

## Route 1: an AI app builder

This is now the cheapest way to test an idea with real people. You describe the screens and data, the builder writes a working app with a database and sign-in, and you publish it. For a founder who has [validated the idea](/articles/ultimate-guide-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-idea-validation-process) and wants something to show customers, it can replace weeks of developer time.

The catch is that the builder writes code you can't read, and some of it guards your customers' data. Two independent findings from the last year show what goes wrong:

- Escape, a security company, scanned more than 5,600 public apps made with AI builders in October 2025. It found more than 2,000 vulnerabilities, more than 400 exposed secrets such as API keys, and 175 cases of exposed personal data, including medical records and bank account numbers ([Escape](https://escape.tech/blog/methodology-how-we-discovered-vulnerabilities-apps-built-with-vibe-coding)).
- In February 2026 The Register reported a single app, showcased on Lovable's own Discover page, that exposed 18,697 user records, including students at UC Berkeley and UC Davis. A sign-in check had been written backwards: it blocked logged-in users and let anonymous ones in ([The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/lovable_app_vulnerabilities/)). Lovable said every project gets a free security scan before publishing, but acting on its findings is up to the owner, and that this project also used code and a database from outside Lovable.

That last sentence is the important one for a non-technical founder: the builder's scan finds problems, but you have to understand and fix them. Our post on [the holes every scan of vibe-coded apps keeps finding](/articles/vibe-coded-app-security-scans) has a 15-minute self-check you can run without reading code.

**Use a builder when:** you need something real to test demand, the data isn't sensitive, and you're willing to rebuild or pay a developer to review before you take money at scale.

## Route 2: a freelancer

A good freelancer turns a clear specification into working software and, unlike a builder, can explain what they built. The cost is the main barrier. For a sense of scale: the US median pay for web developers and digital designers was $47.85 an hour in May 2025 ([US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm)). That's what employees earn; freelancers usually charge more, because the rate also covers their own taxes, tools and the gaps between projects, while rates in other countries can be much lower.

Our arithmetic at that median: a small SaaS first version of 200 to 400 hours (sign-in, a few screens, a database, payments, an admin page) comes to roughly $9,600 to $19,100. Your quote will differ, but it shows why a clear scope matters more than an hourly rate.

What still works from the 2021 version of this guide:

- **Prefer fixed prices per milestone.** Hourly billing is hard to predict when you can't judge the work. Pay on milestones you can see and test: "users can sign up and reset their password", not "backend 50% done".
- **Ask about past projects like yours,** and talk to one of their past clients.
- **Own everything from day one.** The code repository, the hosting account, the domain and the database should be in your name, with the freelancer invited. This is the clause founders most often regret leaving out.
- **Ask for the security basics in writing:** access rules on every table, no secret keys in the browser, and a list of what was tested.

Freelancers are a poor fit if you have no time to manage the project, if the product handles health or financial data, or if you can't say what you want built. In those cases a partner, or a builder prototype first, is the better route.

## Route 3: a partner or agency

A partner is a team that takes responsibility for design, building and often hosting. You pay more than for a freelancer, and get project management, a second pair of eyes on security and someone accountable when things break. For regulated data or a fixed launch date, this is usually the safer route. Judge a partner by the products they've shipped that are still running, not by their portfolio screenshots, and ask who will maintain the product after launch and at what cost.

## The security baseline, on any route

Whichever route you choose, these are the checks we'd want before real customers sign up. You don't need to code to ask for them, and you should get a yes or a demonstration for each:

1. **Every database table has access rules.** A signed-in user can see only their own records, and an anonymous visitor sees nothing private.
2. **No secret keys in the web page.** Payment and email keys live on a server, never in the browser's code.
3. **Sign-in and password reset work, and fail safely.** Try a wrong password, an expired reset link and someone else's record address.
4. **Backups exist and someone has restored one.**
5. **You know where the data is stored,** which matters if you have EU customers.

The OWASP Top 10, the industry's standard list of web application risks, puts broken access control first ([OWASP](https://top10.owasp.org/2025)). It's the same problem as the backwards sign-in check above, and it is the first thing to ask about.

## How to be a client developers do good work for

This section comes from our 2021 post on being an excellent client, and it applies to freelancers, partners and, surprisingly, AI builders too, because all three do better with a clear brief.

- **Write the job, not the features.** "A dog groomer books a client in under a minute from their phone" tells a developer what matters. A list of 40 features doesn't.
- **Give feedback within a day.** Slow answers are the most common reason small projects slip. Batch your comments, and test on a real phone.
- **Be clear about budget and dates,** and say which one you'd move if you had to.
- **Separate bugs from changes.** A bug is something that doesn't work as agreed; a change is something you now want differently. Both are fine, but only one is free.
- **Say what's working.** Developers who know which parts you like protect them when they change other parts.
- **Show up.** A weekly 30-minute call where you click through the latest version beats any status report.

## What changed since 2021, and what didn't

The old guide spent many paragraphs explaining servers, databases and front ends. You can now ask any AI assistant for that, so we've cut it. Two things haven't changed:

- **The idea still has to be tested before the build.** No route makes up for building something nobody wants. Our guide on [when to launch an MVP](/articles/when-is-the-right-time-to-launch-an-mvp) covers how small the first version can be.
- **Someone still has to be responsible for the data.** A builder makes the first version cheap, but it doesn't take responsibility for your customers' records. Either you learn enough to check the baseline above, or you pay someone who does.

If you're working out how long your savings last while you build, our [startup runway calculator](/tools/business/startup-runway-calculator/) does the arithmetic, and the [freelance rate calculator](/tools/business/freelance-rate-calculator/) shows what a freelancer must charge to earn a given salary, which helps when you compare quotes.

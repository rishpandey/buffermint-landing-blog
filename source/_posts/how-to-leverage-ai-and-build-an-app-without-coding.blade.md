In 2021 this post said you could build an app without code by wiring together AI services such as IBM Watson and Clarifai. That advice is out of date. In 2026 "building without code" means something more direct: you describe the app in plain English to an AI app builder, and it writes, runs and publishes the code for you.

The three builders founders ask us about most are Lovable, Bolt and Replit. All three can produce a working web app with sign-in and a database in an afternoon. They differ in how they charge, what you own at the end, and how much of the result you'll need to check. This post compares them on the numbers each company publishes, as of October 2026, and ends with the checks every app built this way needs before it holds real customer data.

## What each plan costs and includes

| | Lovable | Bolt | Replit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Free plan | 5 build credits a day, capped at 30 a month | 1M tokens a month, 300K a day | Starter: 1 published app, for 30 days |
| Entry paid plan | Pro, $25/month ($21 billed yearly) | Pro, $25/month | Core, $20/month ($18 billed yearly) |
| What the entry plan includes | 100 credits a month plus 5 a day | 10M tokens a month, no daily cap | $20 of usage credits a month |
| Unit of billing | Credits per message, by effort | Tokens processed | Effort-based, per checkpoint |
| Next plan | Business, $50/month | Teams, $30 per member | Pro, $100/month |
| Code export | Edit and download code on Pro | Own domain on Pro | Full code in the workspace |

Sources for the table: Lovable's plan documentation ([plans](https://docs.lovable.dev/introduction/subscription-plans), [credits](https://docs.lovable.dev/introduction/plans-and-credits)), Bolt's [pricing page](https://bolt.new/pricing), and Replit's [pricing page](https://replit.com/pricing) and [billing docs](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing), all read on 29 October 2026. Prices change often in this market; check the pages before you commit.

## What a typical build burns

The plans are easy to compare. The hard question is how far the allowance goes, because none of the three charges a fixed amount per change.

**Lovable** publishes illustrative costs per request in its credits documentation: changing a button's style about 0.5 credits, removing a footer about 0.9, adding sign-in about 1.2, and building a landing page with generated images about 2 ([Lovable docs](https://docs.lovable.dev/introduction/plans-and-credits)). Planning messages cost 1 credit each.

Our arithmetic from those figures: Pro gives 100 monthly credits plus 5 a day, so about 250 credits in a 30-day month. That's roughly 200 changes the size of "add sign-in", or 500 small style tweaks. A first version of a simple SaaS (sign-in, three or four screens, a database, a settings page) typically takes dozens of requests plus many rounds of fixes, so one month of Pro is enough for a first version if your requests are clear. Vague requests ("make it better") cost the most, because they produce changes you then pay to undo.

**Bolt** bills by tokens, the units of text the AI model reads and writes. The Pro plan's 10 million tokens a month has no daily cap, and unused tokens roll over ([Bolt](https://bolt.new/pricing)). Bolt doesn't publish a per-change figure. Each request re-reads part of your project, so the same change usually costs more as the app grows. Watch the token meter during your first week to learn your own rate.

**Replit** uses effort-based pricing: simple requests such as small fixes cost less than complex builds, and each request ends in one checkpoint ([Replit docs](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing)). Replit asks for confirmation before a paid action starts. Core includes $20 of credits a month; Pro includes $100, and Pro credits roll over for two months.

**What this means in practice:** for a first version, all three cost about the same, $20–25 a month, if you plan your requests. The bill grows with the size of the app and the number of fix-up rounds, not with your number of users. Hosting, the database and AI features used inside your app are billed separately on all three, so add them before you set prices. Our [LLM cost calculator](/tools/ai/llm-cost/) helps if your app itself calls an AI model.

## How the three differ in use

- **Lovable** is aimed at founders who don't want to see code. It connects to a Supabase database for sign-in and storage, and its paid plans let you edit and download the code. It's the most common choice for a first SaaS prototype.
- **Bolt** runs the development environment in your browser, and lets you choose the database provider on Pro. It suits people who want to look at the code now and then.
- **Replit** is a full online development environment with an AI agent on top. It's the most flexible of the three and the closest to a normal developer workflow, which also makes it the one where a non-technical founder is most likely to get lost.

If you don't read code at all, start with the one whose output you can most easily explain to a developer later. That developer review is not optional, for the reason below.

## The security checks every no-code app needs

AI builders write code that works; they don't always write code that keeps data private. Two independent reports show the pattern:

- Escape's October 2025 scan of more than 5,600 public apps built with AI builders found more than 2,000 vulnerabilities, more than 400 exposed secrets and 175 cases of exposed personal data. More than 4,000 of the apps were built with Lovable, with smaller samples from Bolt and others ([Escape](https://escape.tech/blog/methodology-how-we-discovered-vulnerabilities-apps-built-with-vibe-coding)).
- In February 2026, a researcher found 16 vulnerabilities, six critical, in one app featured on Lovable's Discover page. It exposed 18,697 user records, because a sign-in check let anonymous visitors in and kept signed-in users out ([The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/27/lovable_app_vulnerabilities/)). Lovable said its pre-publish scan is free but acting on it is the owner's job, and that the project also used code and a database from outside Lovable.

Before your app holds customer data, check at least these:

1. **Access rules on every table.** Open the app in a private browser window without signing in and try the addresses of pages that show data. You should see nothing private.
2. **No secret keys in the page.** Payment and email keys belong on a server. Our [JSON formatter](/tools/dev/json-formatter/) makes it easier to read the settings your app loads in the browser.
3. **Run the builder's own security scan** and fix everything it reports, not just the first page.
4. **Pay a developer for a short review** before you charge money. A day of review costs far less than an incident.

Our post on [the holes every scan of vibe-coded apps keeps finding](/articles/vibe-coded-app-security-scans) goes through these in more depth, with a 15-minute self-check.

## When to stop using a builder

The builder is the right tool while you're finding out whether anyone wants the product. Signs you've outgrown it:

- each change breaks something else, and fixing it costs more credits than the change did;
- you need a feature the builder can't do well, such as background jobs, complex permissions or a specific payment flow;
- you're handling sensitive data (health, finance, children) and need someone accountable for it.

At that point, export the code and hand it to a developer, or rebuild with one using what you learned. Our guide for [non-technical founders launching a SaaS](/articles/launching-a-saas-product-as-a-non-technical-founder) compares the routes and their costs.

## What changed since 2021

The 2021 version of this post listed AI services you could connect without code. The idea was right, but the tools were for adding one AI feature to an app someone else built. The builders above build the whole app. What hasn't changed is that the tool doesn't take responsibility for what it builds: someone still has to check that the app does what customers think it does with their data.
